# ATM Program Explanation

This file provides an explanation of the C code for a simple ATM (Automated Teller Machine) program. The code simulates an ATM interface, allowing users to check their balance, make withdrawals, and deposits, and exit the transaction. Let's break down the code step by step:

## Current Date and Time

The program starts by displaying the current date and time using the `time_t` and `ctime` functions. It sets the initial PIN code to "0508".

## PIN Validation

The user is prompted to enter their PIN code. The code uses `getch()` to hide the entered characters with asterisks ('*'). It compares the entered PIN with the predefined PIN.

- If the entered PIN is correct, the user is granted access to the ATM, and they are provided with options for transactions.
- If the entered PIN is incorrect, the user has three attempts to enter the correct PIN. If they fail three times, the program exits with a "LIMIT EXCEEDED" message and a beep sound.

## Transaction Options

Once the correct PIN is entered, the user is presented with several transaction options:

- **Balance Inquiry (Option 1):** Displays the current balance.
- **Withdrawal (Option 2):** Allows the user to withdraw an amount, updating the balance accordingly. If the balance is insufficient, it displays an "INSUFFICIENT BALANCE" message.
- **Deposit (Option 3):** Lets the user deposit an amount, updating the balance.
- **Exit (Option 4):** Allows the user to exit the transaction.

## Transaction Loop

The program utilizes a loop that continues until the user chooses to exit the transaction. After each transaction, the user is prompted to continue or exit.

## Beep Sound

The program uses the `Beep` function to produce beep sounds in case of incorrect PIN entries or invalid transactions.

## Conclusion

This simple C program provides basic ATM functionality with PIN validation, balance inquiry, withdrawal, and deposit options. Users can perform these transactions until they choose to exit the program.
